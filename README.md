# mcs-format
Formatter for microchip studio AVR assembly files.  
Watches .asm files in selected microchip studio solution folder for changes, and formats the files.
This is in super beta and I would not trust your mission critical files to it.
There is a "auto reload files when changed outside the editor" feature in microchip studio, unfortunately it does not work.  To see the changes to a file, you have to close and re-open it within microchip studio.
